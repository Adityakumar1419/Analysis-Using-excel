ElectricPe Lead-to-Delivery Funnel Analysis
Business Analyst Internship Assignment – Data Exploration & Storytelling

This repository contains my analytical work on ElectricPe’s real-world lead, booking, and delivery dataset. The objective was to understand customer movement across the funnel, identify bottlenecks, and generate actionable business insights.

1. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Processed the raw dataset and created new classification columns such as Hot/Warm/Cold lead segments, funnel stage categories, and derived metrics.

Standardized missing values, corrected data types, and prepared the dataset for analysis.

2. Funnel & Operational Analysis

Using the cleaned dataset, I evaluated key funnel metrics:

Conversion rates from Lead → Pre-booking → Booking → Delivery

Cancellation behaviour and top reasons

Store-level performance, including TAT (Turnaround Time)

Customer rating patterns and NPS estimation

3. Correlation & Exploratory Insights

Computed correlations between lead type, booking likelihood, delivery TAT, cancellations, and customer ratings.

Identified patterns that clarify which customer segments and operational factors most influence conversions.

4. Visual Storytelling

Created clear and intuitive visualizations, including:

Conversion funnels

Correlation heatmaps

Distribution plots

Store-wise performance graphs

Tools Used:

Python / Pandas

Excel

Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly

PowerPoint for storytelling
